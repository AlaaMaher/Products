# Products 

## This project demonstrates how to use the recommended Android App Architecture including MVVM, Clean Architecture, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, and Coil. 
The app has one screen that fetches products from the Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and displays them.

## Features

- Fetches and displays a list of products from the Fake Store API.
- Uses MVVM architecture for separation of concerns.
- Implements Clean Architecture principles for better code organization and testability.
- Utilizes Jetpack Compose for building the UI.
- Integrates Hilt for dependency injection.
- Uses Coil for efficient image loading.

## Libraries Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the UI with a modern and declarative approach.
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection, provide a standard way to manage dependencies in your application.
- **Coil**: For image loading and caching.
- **ViewModel**: To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **LiveData**: To notify the UI about data changes.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests to the Fake Store API.
- **Gson**: For JSON parsing of API responses.
- **Coroutines**: For managing background threads with simplified code and reducing callback needs.
